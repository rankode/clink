        Dear Ash,
        
        A very happy birthday to you. I wish you, all the happiness in the world. 
        I feel so fortunate that you are in my life - a most wonderful thing to transpire.
        
        Settlers of Catan. Fam events. Tech breakdowns. Too many coffee runs ($$). Vodka. You are 
        a wonderful teacher, friend and relative. Your ability to inspire others, to drive 
        change + be passionate about the things / projects you undertake - it is really pretty
        spesh.
       
        [hug]
        
        Much love st-Uncle.
